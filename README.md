# React-Full-Stack-Portfolio

##Description

This is my personal portfolio that will be used and updated throughout the BCS bootcamp. My portfolio will be the main foundation for which employeers can view my professional and educational experience when selecting future employees. Due to this, my portfolio must be presentable for any employeer or individual. Therefore; my portfolio displays an about me section to get a grasp of who I am, it shows my projects that I have worked on throughout the BCS course so far, and it has links to my github account and LinkedIn profile for more information. This Portfolio was created using react, itrs a replica of the portfolio made in the beginning of teh course.

To access, copy the repository in github, then use the git clone function in command line to clone this repository into your local machine.
