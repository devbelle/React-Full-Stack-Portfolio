                <p>Hello! My name is Devin Belle and this is my portfolio. I am an aspiring full stack developer currently undertaking a coding bootcamp in the hopes of breaking out into the tech industry
                after graduating. My work experience includes a combination of customer service and warehouse management working at companies such as XPO Logistics, Amazon, and Cox Transportation services.
                During the 2020 pandemic, my interest in coding started with small self-made projects before I started taking this field as a serious endeavor. In this portfolio are the University of Richmond
                BCS bootcamp projects I have worked on in the past 6 months. Each project demonstrate my abilities working with coding languages such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, and more. If you are interested in 
                working with me in the future or would like to offer me any available positions, please click the link to my contact me section. The contact me has links to my LinkedIn and Github for more
                information you may like to know about me. Let's get down business!
